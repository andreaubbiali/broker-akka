# What is this?

This is an example detached from others, used to see the actor hierarchy in Akka.

The response are:
```shell
    First: Actor[akka://testSystem/user/first-actor#397142239]
    Second: Actor[akka://testSystem/user/first-actor/second-actor#-72907485]
```

So we can see that every actor I created is under the user actor.
